# iOS-Portfolio-Stoppel22
  Hey, I'm Jackson Stoppel, and this is a portfolio of what I'm currently working on and what I've worked on in the past. I first got into coding in the summer of 2020, while I was stuck in my house. I decided that making my own video game would be cool, so I started to watch YouTube videos and teach myself C# while working with Unity. Later that year, I also started a podcast with my friend. It was just something we did for fun, but I taught myself some Html and Java via YouTube and other online resources to make a website for the podcast. I also took AP Computer Science Principles and made a rocket game in early 2021 mostly with MIT App Inventor. In the second semester of 2022, my senior year of high school, I took both AP Java and iOS App Development and worked on several projects in both classes using Java and SwiftUI respectively. 
## Apps
#### 2020
## Overkill Hill
Using C# and the program Unity, I created (but didn't finish) a game called Overkill Hill. It is a side scrolling run game in which you are trying to get your character to the top of the hill while also avoiding objects that the boss at the top of the hill is rolling or throwing down at you. You also have the option to change the skin of the character and buy new skins by obtaining coins by beating the boss on each level. This info is saved when you leave the app and go back into it.![IMG_7812](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98774916/162058962-e1ff9925-cd75-4108-a337-f508910dcd46.PNG)

## Chillin' With Cocoa Website
I created a website (the domain has expired by now) for a podcast me and my friend worked on called "Chillin' With Cocoa", which we would just drink hot cocoa and talk about dumb stuff. The website was comprised of several tabs each containing different information about the podcast. One was our home page, which had an embeded YouTube video that we filmed as an intro to the podcast. The website also had a tab about each of us, a tab with an embeded Google Sheets document to keep track of what hot cocoa we were drinking, and a tab that had all of the video versions of the podcast embeded. Overall the project helped me learn more about HTML and web design, as well as collaboration with others on public projects.

## Rocket Game
A game I made as a project for AP Computer Science Principles. It was made using simplistic block programing in MIT App Inventor. You play as a spaceship moving around the screen via touch controls, trying to avoid asteroids. You have a score that starts at 0 and goes up every second you're alive. There are also astornauts falling that add 5 to your score it you hit them, and potions that give you a shield so you can be hit once by an asteroid and survive.

An app comprised of 8 drum pads, all making a different drum sound. The app was created using SwiftUI for the code, and Sketch for the assets.
